    <h2 class="fs-1"><strong>MY NOTE</strong></h2>
    <p>The first memory I have of Virat Kohli was when I saw an award nomination 
        for the most goodlooking sportsperson and he won it(I know not the ideal 
        intro but still). <br>
        The year was 2014, I saw that years IPL and fell in love with duo of ABD and Virat, 
        that day I started supporting RCB and following Virat . 2016 IPL is still my favourite,
        the duo of The Alien and The King scoring centuries for fun , demolishing the bowling units and 
        Virat reaching the 973 runs and 4 centuries (still by heart :)) .
        The 2016 final was the first time I relaised I could cry for the loss of a team, which I am 
        not part of. The more I searched more I started to admire him. The sheer amount of hardwork
        and effort the guy did. I will never debate that 
        the guy is better than Sachin Tendulkar, but I will say this , I never saw the master blaster 
        in his prime and couldn't understand the craze people had for him, but now I do.<br>
        When people used to compare Virat to Sachin, I used to see these comments on how Virat is still
        young and shouldnt be compared etc, and I would think why are they being so dramatic. But now seeing 
        him being compared youngsters I understand.<br>
        The year 2021 was really shitty for everyone, but things got worse when he stepped down from captaincy 
        first in IPL, then T20I, later got sacked from ODI captaincy (as if things werent bad enough with his 2 year
        century drought). As if things weren't bad enough he even stepped down from test cpataincy.  
        <br>
        <br>
        Whatever maybe happeing, I just want to see the RunMachine back in action, the person who made me want to watch
        Test cricket , made the world believe that India is a fortess in Test Cricket (never lost a home Test series as
        captain). The guy who used to hit back when he was sledged and would take the match home single handedly. The guy 
        whose hard work has been an inspiration to me and the only person with over 50 average in all formats.

    <h2 class="fs-1"><strong>RECORDS</strong></h2>
    <p>
        I would have put a record section somewhere here, but it would just fill the whole page.
        <br>The only one which matters : The guy is compared to the God of Cricket. I think that 
        says enough.
